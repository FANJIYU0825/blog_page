## Experiences


🛠 Study Cat: **Data Scientist (2020)**

Gained insights into data-driven decision making and predictive modeling.


- Applied statistical learning techniques to analyze and present user behavior data, including collecting user usage data and using time series analysis to predict user behavior patterns.
- Conducted NLP analysis to measure the impact of different word combinations on consumer behavior, identified areas where learning effectiveness might have decreased, and provided feedback to both students and teachers on their focus levels during the learning process.
- Developed a data collection system for monitoring student focus levels during learning, and utilized the resulting model to significantly improve exam scores, achieving a high accuracy rate of up to 90%.
- Utilized AWS to design system architecture and implemented NLP analysis and Python for data processing and modeling.



🛠 Worm Hole Tech: **Backend Data Engineering (2021)**

- Developed a keen understanding of the relationship between
front-end and back-end systems.

**Worked on projects such as:**

- Taiwei Industrial Intelligent Manufacturing System:
    - Collected data from MQTT server.
    - Predicted machine life cycle.
    - Reduced electric consumption by **5%**.
- Xinxing Electronic IQC System:
    - Learned the entire development and design process.
    - Understood how functional specification documents evolve into fully functional systems.
    - Leveraged prior experience in the warehouse domain to optimize the system.
    - Listened to client needs, gathered requirements, and developed solutions accordingly.




🛠 Rapixus Information: **Back-end Engineering Intern (2022)**

- Design Clean Architecture for easy unit testing, and separate backend into DB, Function, Test, and API.
- Apply DFS technique to find and fix Microsoft Secure Issue related issues by searching for similar Secure Issues and fixing them quickly.

👨🏻‍💻 **Open domain QA (2022)**

This project, plan to create

- QA system using the baseball wiki as a template to generate related QA questions.
- We will utilize two techniques to build this system:
- Information Retrieval System: We will use an information retrieval system to search the baseball wiki and retrieve relevant articles and sections based on the user's input question. This will help us to identify the relevant information and present it to the user.
- retrained models: We will use pre-trained models to generate questions based on the retrieved information. These models will help us to generate questions that are relevant and closely related to the user's input.

By combining these techniques, we aim to create an **efficient and accurate QA system** that can help users to quickly find the information they need.




👨🏻‍💻 NSTC Project: Analysis of Web User Mental Health (2023):

- Assessed the mental health of users.
- Predicted whether a poster's mental state is healthy or unhealthy.
- Enabled the language model to identify unhealthy stances.
